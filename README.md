# Huffman compression in c 

This is a school project aiming to implement huffman compression in C
The project is considered "finished". This is a repo used for archives only.

## run:
`make init && make run`

## issues : 
I have still some issues : for some reasons it doesnt work with bigger imputs.

## notes for next time : 
do NOT do chain list everywhere. Taking 255 * sizeof(char) is not that big of a deal, 
compared to the dev time and lack of optimization (regarding speed) i did.
